1.The project demonstrates communication between two peers.

2.The command line arguments in the run.batch file are, first the port number of the 
instance,and second, the sender port no, i.e. port where the file needs to be uploaded.

3.I have used 2 port numbers, 9080 and 9081, and files from both the peers are transfered
 to each other.

4. We can see the successful uploaded message, and which file has been transfered
  from which port to which port.

5.Also, as the solution is same, and as we are making two instances, we can see the 
  downloaded file in the same /DownloadedFiles folder.

6. One peer is transfering Testing1.txt and other peer is trasnfering Testing2.txt

7. Initially,before starting the project, the /DownloadedFiles folder is empty.

8. We can see both the files successfully transfered in the same /DownloadedFiles folder,
   but please note that, two separate peers are downloading the file.

9. Also, in the Executive, based on the port number, which file to be transfered is being
   selected.


Thank you!
